           <p class="blog-post-meta">Posted by Tim in <a name="teaching">#teaching</a></p>

           <p>This study conducted by Burke attempts to collect and analyze rhetoric surrounding computer programming in academic environments over a period of three decades. In his research, Burke analyzed 67 peer-reviewed sources related to computer science in the K-12 setting. Burke begins by introducing several of the leading proposals for instructing K-12 students to code: as a new literacy, as a grounded form of math, or as a technical skill. He then proceeds to define the importance of metaphors, highlighting that utilizing metaphors correctly will properly introduce foreign concepts to the uninitiated. The first metaphor, as a new literacy, is by far the most popular attempt to sell coding in the classroom. It appeared in 32 of the articles, and Burke remarks that this metaphor is apt for the most part. Coding is traditionally synonymous with language because the means to program is through a variety of scripted languages. He does warn that it isn’t a perfect metaphor because mistakes in programming are more costly than those in human language. The second metaphor, as grounded math, has fallen out of favor over the years. This particular metaphor doesn’t hold up because research revealed that math scores did not improve with mastery of certain introductory programming languages. Finally the metaphor, as a technical skill, is used to portray coding as a pathway to a career a la a 21st century wood-shop course.

           <p class="blog-post-meta">Posted by Tim in <a href="#">#teaching</a></p>
           <p>In this article Colby recounts thousands of hours introducing children to code via the Hour of Code initiative conceived by Code.org. She contends that students should be introduced to computer programming before high school because sixty percent of all projected math and science careers will be related to computing. In her attempts to host the event she explains several unforeseen issues to contend with before the actual event. Hardware limitations, bandwidth considerations, and server capacity are all important aspects to analyze before an event. It is also highly important to limit the scope and options when teaching in such a limited setting. For her Hour of Code, a single tutorial was selected for all students to follow. This ensured volunteers could be trained and excessive bandwidth wouldn’t be consumed. During events Colby provides a short introduction then allows the students to work at their own pace. They are encouraged to ask volunteers for help, and upon completion proceed to other tutorials offered on the Hour of Code website. Finally, collecting feedback on common issues among participants can help improve future sessions.

           <p class="blog-post-meta">Posted by Tim in <a href="#">#teaching</a></p>
           <p>In, Computational Thinking, the researchers revisit an influential article of the same title by Jeannette Wing. Wing (2006), proposed that “computational thinking involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding behavior.” The growing interest in teaching young students programming concepts caused the researchers to apply the same tenets in a K-12 environment. One of the key principles to take-away includes that of the “low floor, high ceiling.” It should be relatively easy for beginners to produce working examples, but with respect to more advanced programmers, the tools chosen should be suitably powerful. Another method that is useful in introductory programming is the “use-modify-create” progression. In this three-stage system students are encourages to try an existing program, then edit that program, and finally create their own program. Grover and Pea, conclude the paper with concerns over the lack of curricula and the over focus on definitions and tools.

           <p>Through the use of a quantitative pre-test/post-test methodology, the researcher investigate the effects of teaching code.org content, particularly, gender differences in relation to problem solving and reflective thinking. In the study 32 primary school students, 17 females and 15 males, were taught via code.org for one hour a week. After a period of five weeks a reflective skill scale was administered. A small “increment in the female students’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving over the males’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving.” Again when overall performance was measured there was only a slight difference based on average completion rates. Ultimately, the course of study benefitted students of both genders through improved geometrical and mathematical knowledge.

           <p>In a more qualitative study, Du, Wimmer and Rada investigates the impact of Hour of Code program on students’ perception towards computer programming. The introduction covers the general lack of interest in programming among students, followed by several statistics that may contribute to this malaise. According to the research difficulty in mastery, increased student anxiety, and gender bias all contribute to lower retention rates. Methods used by the Hour of Code program such as programming visually and focusing on languages with higher levels of abstraction can ease younger students into the field. This in turn should increase retention and elevate the number of students who participate in undergraduate computer science programs. Du, Wimmer, and Rada surveyed 116 undergraduate students in an attempt to measure if Hour of Code increased student interest in pursuing programming. The results revealed that completing the program did positively impact student perception towards programming, but levels of accuracy and understanding were highly dependent.

             This article covers a trend in which volunteer groups provide computer science lessons to children in an attempt to stimulate their interest in computer programming. Particularly, this study focuses on the inclusion of girls in coding camps. They posit that growing up surrounded by the digital doesn’t necessary equate to being digitally literate. Hence, the uprising of volunteer code clubs provide an essential service in increasing digital competence among children. By conducting three group interviews the researchers gathered a more in-depth view of how the initiatives are paying off. Their observations concluded that club students were active, concentrated, and engaged. Qualitative measures such as level of ambition and experiencing fun are also mentioned in relation to learners in the program. They followed-up the interviews with conclusions based on gender balance. The authors suggest that there is an imbalance, but they do not believe it is content related. Instead, they consider it culture related. In order to alleviate this problem, they suggest offering these clubs in areas where girls and boys are present such as on school grounds.

             Solomon provides a brief history of microcomputers, suggesting that coding was essential in the early days of the PC. It is mentioned that even Radio Shack, a now defunct vendor of electronics, offered teachers free classes on BASIC, a all-purpose programming language. She continues to describe the increasing complexity of software throughout the 90’s, the introduction of web site construction, and finally the Application revolution. Solomon concludes that young people are part of a trend similar to the computing revolution, but instead of following step-by-step magazine articles on inputing code, they are exposed to Apps that can instill logic, reasoning and problem-solving via programming. Some of the tools she mentions include CodeMonkey, Codecademy, Kodable, and Kojo.

             The researchers in this study seek to find a correlation between introducing engaging programming applications and increased interest in computer science. They argue that coding is considered the fourth literacy, yet enrollments in programming courses is in decline. Through the use of two block-based programming applications, Scratch and App Inventor, they conducted a four-month evaluation. A sample of 87 high school students were taught programming  utilizing the aforementioned tools. Half were taught using Scratch and the other half was taught using App Inventor, while a control group was taught with traditional methods. Their performance was measured and the results concluded learners using AIA improved the most, followed by Scratch users. The control group showed the poorest improvement among the students.

           <p>
            Another approach to mobile learning is to utilize mobile video content to enhance competency.  With e-learning being a popular and viable solution, the use of video content has become increasingly adopted in the field of education. The benefits of mobile video content are directly related to student empowerment. The content can be easily accessed and slowed down, sped up, or repeated. There is also the ability for students to choose the type of device in which they view the content. Many of these benefits translate well to content in the programming and software engineering environment. As mentioned in the paper, video learning provides knowledge construction, promotes conversation, clear articulation, opportunities for collaboration, and reflection. By implementing mobile video learning, programming skills can be improved.

           <p>
             This paper highlights the difficulties of introducing programming concepts to amateurs, and provides results from an experimental approach to overcome said difficulties. The major barriers to learning concepts tend to be related to language syntax or lack of guidance. Visual programming languages such as Scratch and Alice have lowered these barriers by removing the requirement to memorize syntax and instead focus on algorithmic thinking. This does still require mentoring though, and the paper presents another solution aimed at self-learning. The researchers designed a web app consisting of six modules, each focusing on a concept related to robotics. In the lessons, learners use Scratch building blocks to program a virtual robot. A total of 46 students around the age of 12 participated in the study. A pre-test, post-test method was used for a five hour work session in which the students utilized the RoBlock software. Upon completion, 96% of the students found the software solution interesting and 48% considered it an autodidactic tool. The results how that autodidactic learning of programming concepts is possible among middle school students, and if the experiment were scaled up and improved upon, greater even greater results might be achieved.
