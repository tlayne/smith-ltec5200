           <p class="blog-post-meta">Posted by Tim in <a href="#">#teaching</a></p>

           <p>This study conducted by Burke attempts to collect and analyze rhetoric surrounding computer programming in academic environments over a period of three decades. In his research, Burke analyzed 67 peer-reviewed sources related to computer science in the K-12 setting. Burke begins by introducing several of the leading proposals for instructing K-12 students to code: as a new literacy, as a grounded form of math, or as a technical skill. He then proceeds to define the importance of metaphors, highlighting that utilizing metaphors correctly will properly introduce foreign concepts to the uninitiated. The first metaphor, as a new literacy, is by far the most popular attempt to sell coding in the classroom. It appeared in 32 of the articles, and Burke remarks that this metaphor is apt for the most part. Coding is traditionally synonymous with language because the means to program is through a variety of scripted languages. He does warn that it isn’t a perfect metaphor because mistakes in programming are more costly than those in human language. The second metaphor, as grounded math, has fallen out of favor over the years. This particular metaphor doesn’t hold up because research revealed that math scores did not improve with mastery of certain introductory programming languages. Finally the metaphor, as a technical skill, is used to portray coding as a pathway to a career a la a 21st century wood-shop course.

           <p class="blog-post-meta">Posted by Tim in <a href="#">#teaching</a></p>
           <p>In this article Colby recounts thousands of hours introducing children to code via the Hour of Code initiative conceived by Code.org. She contends that students should be introduced to computer programming before high school because sixty percent of all projected math and science careers will be related to computing. In her attempts to host the event she explains several unforeseen issues to contend with before the actual event. Hardware limitations, bandwidth considerations, and server capacity are all important aspects to analyze before an event. It is also highly important to limit the scope and options when teaching in such a limited setting. For her Hour of Code, a single tutorial was selected for all students to follow. This ensured volunteers could be trained and excessive bandwidth wouldn’t be consumed. During events Colby provides a short introduction then allows the students to work at their own pace. They are encouraged to ask volunteers for help, and upon completion proceed to other tutorials offered on the Hour of Code website. Finally, collecting feedback on common issues among participants can help improve future sessions.

           <p class="blog-post-meta">Posted by Tim in <a href="#">#teaching</a></p>
           <p>In, Computational Thinking, the researchers revisit an influential article of the same title by Jeannette Wing. Wing (2006), proposed that “computational thinking involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding behavior.” The growing interest in teaching young students programming concepts caused the researchers to apply the same tenets in a K-12 environment. One of the key principles to take-away includes that of the “low floor, high ceiling.” It should be relatively easy for beginners to produce working examples, but with respect to more advanced programmers, the tools chosen should be suitably powerful. Another method that is useful in introductory programming is the “use-modify-create” progression. In this three-stage system students are encourages to try an existing program, then edit that program, and finally create their own program. Grover and Pea, conclude the paper with concerns over the lack of curricula and the over focus on definitions and tools.

           <p>Through the use of a quantitative pre-test/post-test methodology, the researcher investigate the effects of teaching code.org content, particularly, gender differences in relation to problem solving and reflective thinking. In the study 32 primary school students, 17 females and 15 males, were taught via code.org for one hour a week. After a period of five weeks a reflective skill scale was administered. A small “increment in the female students’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving over the males’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving.” Again when overall performance was measured there was only a slight difference based on average completion rates. Ultimately, the course of study benefitted students of both genders through improved geometrical and mathematical knowledge.

           <h2 class="blog-post-title">Hour of Code</h2>
           <p class="blog-post-meta">Posted by Tim in <a href="#">#teaching</a></p>
           <p>In a more qualitative study, Du, Wimmer and Rada investigates the impact of Hour of Code program on students’ perception towards computer programming. The introduction covers the general lack of interest in programming among students, followed by several statistics that may contribute to this malaise. According to the research difficulty in mastery, increased student anxiety, and gender bias all contribute to lower retention rates. Methods used by the Hour of Code program such as programming visually and focusing on languages with higher levels of abstraction can ease younger students into the field. This in turn should increase retention and elevate the number of students who participate in undergraduate computer science programs. Du, Wimmer, and Rada surveyed 116 undergraduate students in an attempt to measure if Hour of Code increased student interest in pursuing programming. The results revealed that completing the program did positively impact student perception towards programming, but levels of accuracy and understanding were highly dependent.
